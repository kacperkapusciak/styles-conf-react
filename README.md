# styles-conf-react

I've rewritten HTML & CSS code from this great book 

üëâ  [https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/ "Learn to Code HTML & CSS")

 into React app using CSS-modules and react-router. 

 To be precise: I do not own design nor the content of this website but I‚Äôve written **all** the JavaScript code of this app by myself i.e. React, Redux etc. Just to make things clear... Cheers ‚úåÔ∏è
